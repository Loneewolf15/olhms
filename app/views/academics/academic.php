                    <p>Our Lady of Hope Schools runs a distinct curriculum, which combines the Nigerian curriculum with the UK National curriculum. The breadth of the curriculum provides students with experiences and learning opportunities across a range of subjects – Science, Mathematics, Humanities, Languages, Business Studies, Music-Art, Drama & Design. In addition to Guidance & Counselling, our enviable academic record in our school results is testament of this robust structure in place, dedication and skills of our teaching staff and the sheer determination of our students.</p>
