                    <p>The Our Lady of Hope School residences for students are designed to be a home away from home. This is important if students are to feel safe and develop to the best of their abilities. For this reason, our purpose-built residential facilities have the right balance of mod-cons and amenities to ensure homeliness, safety and pastoral care.
                        An experienced House Parent runs each residence. An Assistant House Parent assists the House Parent. Their roles are to provide a seamless link between the academic and pastoral spheres of each student’s life. They are in a position to monitor, guide and report on the progress of each student in their house.</p>
