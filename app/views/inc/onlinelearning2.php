            </div>
            <p>Technology is just a tool, we need technology in every classroom and in every learner and teacherâ€™s hand, because it is the pen and paper of our time, and it is the lens through which we experience much of our world. And because education is evolving due to the impact of the internet, teaching and learning must also evolve in like manner. At Our Lady Of Hope Montessori Schools, technology is a big part of our settings. Lessons, assignments, holiday projects, newsletters not forgetting controlled computer-based test(CBT)and more are delivered via our school portal( Click here to logon )</p>
