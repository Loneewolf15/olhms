            <p style="text-align: justify;">"On behalf of the board and management and other members of our exceptional school.<br> I welcome you to our school community. Our school prides itself on offering our learners and their families a nurturing environment which challenges all of our children to do their very best work and to learn and practice the importance of being a responsible, respectful and a God-fearing person. We have beautiful Montessori environments filled with Montessori materials that provide a hands-on approach to learning as children work from the concrete to abstract in their thinking. Our educators and staff members help learners gain independence through making good choices while learning and working in multi-aged or single aged classrooms. We have high expectations for our parents and hope they will become involved in the learning journey of their children. We therefore expect all stake holders to be on the same page: children, teachers and parents must understand that education is not restricted to lessons taught in the classroom. Parents and teachers must encourage children to ask as many questions as they can. For it is in wanting to know that will result in getting to know. The thirst for knowledge is not restricted to the child. It is also essential for a parent and a teacher to keep adding to their own knowledge bank by keeping their eyes and ears open and by reading as much as possible and ensuring that children develop these habits as well. We look forward to a fulfilled experience with you as you join our school community. If you have questions about Our Lady Of Hope Montessori School, please do not hesitate to reach out via our designated platforms, We will be happy to speak with you about a truly wonderful place for your family and children to be in school. We are a community of exceptionally different people. Welcome!"</p>
