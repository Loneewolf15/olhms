                    <p>These are essential components of Our Lady of Hope School for students and staff alike. These include sports, intellectual activities and cultural celebrations. These activities take place on weekends and in the evenings, after school hours on weekdays.

                        Our Lady of Hope School facilities are designed to enable students gain an increasingly rich variety of experiences and develop not only their skills in performance, creativity and craftsmanship, but also to develop their critical and appreciative faculties as members of an audience.

                        On Saturdays, students engage in sports like lawn tennis, volleyball, badminton, table tennis, basketball, netball, football, hockey and athletics while a few hours on Sunday is reserved to train pro-student players, offering them an opportunity to join the official school team.</p>

                    The wellness of students is of paramount importance. At Our Lady of Hope School, we have a well-equipped Medical Clinic, staffed with qualified school nurses to deal with medical situations in the event that a student requires medical attention. Students with more needs are transferred to the resident hospital in the area.
