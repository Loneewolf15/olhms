                    <p>A school’s curriculum is the bedrock of any meaningful learning. At Our Lady of Hope Montessori Schools, our curriculum is a smooth blend of the Montessori curriculum and the Nigerian National curriculum infused with sound Christian faith and values. Our curriculum is designed to meet the needs of the 21st century learner with play having a major role in it’s delivery.</p>

                    </div>
                    <hr />
                    <p>Education starts from birth, but for it to be effective, it must mirror the developmental maturity of the child. For example, while the learning capacity of a 30-year-old may not be markedly different from that of a 35-year-old, it is not same for the difference in learning capacities of a 1-, 2-, or 3-year-old or and older children as their learning is more obvious and dramatic. Concepts are processed and assimilated differently by children within this each range. So, for education to be most effective and fun, it must take into account the age – that is, the developmental maturity or readiness – of a child.
                        <br><br><strong> Brains Are Built, Not Born.</strong><br>Recently, much has been written about the latest findings of researchers into brain development in young children. It stresses the fact that the timing and quality of early experiences combine to shape the brain architecture. Brain architecture is dependent on age-appropriate experiences, stimulating environment, and genetic framework. Just as a house is constructed from the ground-up and with hardy material to build a strong foundation and long-lasting structure, so it is with brain development: Certain experiences must happen in a sequence and with adequate exposure in order to first mature low-level brain circuits that can support long-term development of high-level circuits for complex learning later.
                        <br><br><strong>Age Is Not Just A Number.</strong><br>According to the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget, children build their own understanding, the way children conceptualize the world, take in information, organize information and experiences, and act upon it all depends on age. Age-appropriate learning is all about adapting to a child’s level of understanding as it relates to his/her her age, identifying the readiness of a child to learn, and then following the best-suited method for teaching. Parents and educators need to consider the mental, emotional and social maturity of a child, rather than choosing an educational path linked only to societal pressure and expectations. Knowledge and information remain useless, unless experience or the skills to process the information are developed in early years. Because early childhood development plays such a large role in later social, emotional, and cognitive well-being, it is vital that these sensitive developmental stages are well nurtured as well as sharpened through age-appropriate learning and experiences.<br><br>At Our Lady of Hope Montessori Schools, age-appropriate class placement depends on both the month and year in which a child is born. Currently, for a child to be age-appropriately placed in our infant school which begins at infant community 1, the child must turn 2 by December 31st of that year, for grade school, the child must turn 6 as by December 31st of that year as well.
